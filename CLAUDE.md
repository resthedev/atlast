# Claude Code Project Guidance

Frontend design reference:
- `/Users/kha/Desktop/Projects/atlast/docs/frontend-style-guide.md`

When making frontend changes in this repo:
- Apply the style guide as the default design baseline.
- Preserve Atlast's "cartographic luxury" tone while allowing thoughtful evolution.
- Prefer reusable tokens/patterns over scattered one-off styling.
- Add distinctive, context-aware details instead of generic UI patterns.
- If a task changes the frontend design system (tokens, shared patterns, visual rules, or component conventions), update `/Users/kha/Desktop/Projects/atlast/docs/frontend-style-guide.md` in the same task.

If a change intentionally breaks from the guide, document the rationale in your summary.
