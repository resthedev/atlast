# Agent Working Notes

This repository uses a shared frontend design language documented at:
- `/Users/kha/Desktop/Projects/atlast/docs/frontend-style-guide.md`

For any frontend/UI change, all coding agents (including Codex and Claude Code) should:
- Read the style guide before implementing.
- Align new UI with the guide's principles and current design DNA.
- Keep outcomes intentional and distinctive, not generic.
- Avoid turning the guide into rigid rules; evolve patterns when justified.
- If a task changes the frontend design system (tokens, shared patterns, visual rules, or component conventions), update `/Users/kha/Desktop/Projects/atlast/docs/frontend-style-guide.md` in the same task.

If a task requires deviating from the guide, state the reason briefly in the task summary or PR notes.
